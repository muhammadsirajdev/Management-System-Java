OOP SEMESTER PROJECT

📌 Overview

The University Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage university operations efficiently. It implements core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and features a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.

🎯 Features

User Management: Handles students, faculty, and staff data.

Course Management: Allows course creation, enrollment, and assignment of instructors.

Fee & Salary Management: Tracks student fees and staff salaries.

Attendance & Grading System: Maintains attendance records and grades.

GUI Interface: User-friendly interface developed using Java Swing.

File Handling: Data persistence using file handling techniques.

🛠️ OOP Concepts Implemented

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental and advanced OOP concepts:

Encapsulation – Data hiding using private attributes and accessors (getters and setters).

Inheritance – Hierarchical structure to avoid redundancy (e.g., Faculty & Student classes inherit from Person class).

Polymorphism – Method overriding and method overloading for flexible functionality.

Abstraction – Abstract classes and interfaces for defining reusable blueprints.

Composition – Objects containing other objects (e.g., University has a list of Students & Faculty).

Interfaces & Generics – Use of interfaces for common behaviors and generics for flexibility.

Static Members – Common properties shared across instances (e.g., university name as a static field).

💻 Technologies Used

Java (OOP, File Handling)

Java Swing (Frontend GUI)
